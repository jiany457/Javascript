Base on presentation feedback, I change the code in airpollution file, and made a callback using parameter instead of hard call the direction function inside the a function. I also, change the the scale of the longtitude and latitude a little to map it more obvious in the virtual, but I still have problem to find how to map such as world wide large scale into small scale of landscape.
